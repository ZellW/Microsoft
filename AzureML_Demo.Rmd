# Introduction

[AzureML](https://studio.azureml.net/) provides an interface to publish web services on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) from your local R environment. The main functions in the package include:

- Workspace: connect to and manage AzureML workspaces
- Datasets: upload and download datasets to and from AzureML workspaces
- Publish: publish R functions as AzureML web services, and update or delete existing services
- Consume: apply any AzureML web service to your R data

> This exercise assumes you have an AzureML account

From your AzureML account, record:

1. Workspace ID
2. Primary Authorization Token

Below may error out.  Inside the Ally firewall blocks the API call.  This does not eliminate the value of AzureML!  Imagine when you are asked to do the impossible within 24 hours.  You have been given raw data.  There is no time to follow a data science workflow.  You can run many models overnight at home.  By the time you wake up, AzureML will have complted and you can quickly learn what model performed the best.  It gives you a great starting point!

```{r}
ws <- workspace(id = "9e8fd908da754c52a531dd572d6176dd", 
                auth = "JBx52ewvpIyTedfFDKZJCVYHBCHqiMU+94Zb+qqF/7SCR2vRezyOriO0J84jzLbwHy+BjMNFM2w0h2sb3aDwaA==")
```

#Examining Datasets, Experiments and Services

The `datasets()`, `experiments()`, and `services()` functions return data frames that contain information about those objects available in the workspace.

The package caches R data frame objects describing available datasets, experiments and services in the workspace environment. That cache can be refreshed at any time with the `refresh()` function. The data frame objects make it relatively easy to sort and filter the datasets, experiments, and services in arbitrary ways. The functions also include filtering options for specific and common filters, like looking up something by name.

Use the `download.datasets()` and `upload.dataset()` functions to download or upload data between R and your Azure workspace. The `download.intermediate.dataset()` function can download ephemeral data from a port in an experiment that is not explicitly stored in your Azure workspace.

Use `delete.datasets()` to remove and delete datasets from the workspace.

The `endpoints(`) function describes Azure web service endpoints, and works with supporting help functions like `endpointHelp()`.

The `publishWebService()` function publishes a custom R function as an AzureML web service, available for use by any client. The `updateWebService()` and `deleteWebServce()` update or delete existing web services, respectively.

Use the `consume()` function to evaluate an Azure ML web service with new data uploaded to AzureML from your R environment.

## Examples

### Workspaces

Work with the AzureML package begins by defining a workspace object. The example below uses the configured workspace ID and authorization token in the `~/.azureml/settings.json` file. Alternatively specify these settings explicitly in the `workspace()` function as outlined above. All of the examples require this step.

```{r eval= FALSE}
ws <- workspace()
ws
```

### Service availability

AzureML is a web service and sometimes operations can’t immediately proceed due to rate limiting or other factors. When this kind of thing occurs, the AzureML R package presents a warning and retries the service a few times before giving up with an error.

###Datasets

AzureML datasets correspond more or less to R data frames. The AzureML package defines four basic dataset operations: 
- list
- upload
- download
- delete

The following example illustrates listing available datasets in your workspace.
```{r}
head(ws$datasets)
```

The list of datasets is presented as an a R data frame with class Datasets. Its print method shows a summary of the datasets, along with all of the available variables. Use any normal R data frame operation to manipulate the datasets. For example, to see the “Owner” value of each dataset:

```{r}
head(ws$datasets$Owner, n=20)
```

### Downloading Datasets

The next example illustrates downloading a specific dataset named “Airport Codes Dataset” from AzureML to your R session. This dataset is presented by AzureML as a “Generic CSV” dataset, and will be parsed by R’s read.table() function. (Other formats are parsed by an appropriate parser, for example `read.arff()`.) The example illustrates passing additional arguments to the `read.table()` function used to parse the data from AzureML in this case.

```{r}
airports <- download.datasets(ws, name = "Airport Codes Dataset", quote="\"")
head(airports)
```

You can use `download.datasets()` to download more than one dataset as a time, returning the results in a list of data frames.

### Uploading R data frames

Use the `upload.dataset()` function to upload R data frames to AzureML.

```{r}
upload.dataset(airquality, ws, name = "Air quality")
head(download.datasets(ws, name = "Air quality"))
```

Delete one or more AzureML datasets with `delete.datasets()`:

```{r}
delete.datasets(ws, name="Air quality")
```

## Experiments

Use the `experiments()` function or simply use the `ws$experiments` data frame object directly to list details about experiments in your AzureML workspace. The `experiments()` function optionally filters experiments by ownership.

```{r}
e <- experiments(ws, filter = "samples")
head(e)
```

The `ws$experiments` object is just an R data frame with class `Experiments`. Its print method shows a summary of the available experiments, but it can otherwise be manipulated like a normal R data frame.

The list of experiments in your workspace is cached in the workspace environment. Use the `refresh()` function to explicitly update the cache at any time.

## Web Services

The AzureML package helps you to publish R functions as AzureML web services that can be consumed anywhere. You can also use the AzureML package to run R data through an existing web service and collect the output.

### Publishing a Web Service

The `publishWebService()` publishes an R function as an AzureML web service. Consider this simple example R function:

```{r}
add <- function(x, y) {x + y}
```

Use the function `publishWebService()` to publish the function as a service named “AzureML-duh”:

```{r}
api <- publishWebService(ws, fun = add, name = "AzureML-duh", inputSchema = list(x = "numeric", y = "numeric"), 
                         outputSchema = list(ans = "numeric"))
```

The example publishes a function of two scalar numeric arguments, returning a single numeric scalar output value. Note that we explicitly define the web service input and output schema in the example. See the examples below for more flexible ways of defining web services with functions of data frames.

The result of `publishWebService()` is an Endpoint object, really just an R data frame with two elements: a list containing the details of the newly created web service, and a list of the endpoints of the web service. From here, you can pass the information on to another user, or use the information to use the web service from R:

```{r}
class(api)
```

```{r}
names(api)
```

The web service created is identical to a web service published through the Azure Machine Learning Studio. From the response, you can get the Web Service’s URL, API Key and Help Page URL, as shown above. The first two are needed to make calls to the web service. The latter has the sample code, sample request and other information for consuming the API from client apps such as mobile and web applications.

> AzureML allows multiple services to have the same name.

```{r}
(helpPageUrl <- api$HelpLocation)
```

Once published, you can update a web service using the updateWebService() or publishWebService() functions. The updateWebService() function is just an alias for publishWebService(), except that the argument serviceId is compulsory.

```{r}
api <- updateWebService(ws, fun = function(x, y) x - y, 
                        inputSchema = list(x = "numeric", y = "numeric"),
                        outputSchema = list(ans = "numeric"),
                        serviceId = api$WebServiceId)   # <<-- Required to update!
```

The “AzureML-duh” service now substracts two numbers instead of adding them.

### Discovering Web Services

Use the `services()` function to list in detail all of the available services in your AzureML workspace, or filter by web service name as shown below:

```{r}
(webservices <- services(ws, name = "AzureML-duh"))
```

Given a service, use the `endpoints()` function to list the AzureML service endpoints for the service:

```{r}
ep <- endpoints(ws, webservices[1, ])
class(ep)
```

```{r}
names(ep)
```

The returned Endpoints object contains all the information needed to consume a web service. The `endpointHelp()` function returns detailed information about an endpoint including its input and output schema and URI.

### Consuming Web Services

Use the `consume()` function to send data to your newly published web service API for scoring.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 6:10)
s <- services(ws, name = "AzureML-duh")
s <- tail(s, 1) # use the last published function, in case of duplicate function names
ep <- endpoints(ws, s)
consume(ep, df)
```

Alternatively, the endpoint primary key and API location can be found on the help page for that specific endpoint, which can be found on Azure Machine Learning Studio. Using the Help Page URL, you can access sample code to build clients that can consume this web service in real time to make predictions.

### Deleting a Web Service

Use `deleteWebservice()` to remove a webservice endpoint that you no longer need or want (like these silly examples):

```{r}
deleteWebService(ws, name = "AzureML-duh")
```

### Other examples of publishing web services

The simplest and perhaps most useful way to define a web service uses functions that take a single data frame argument and return a vector or data frame of results. The next example trains a generalized boosted regression model using the gbm package, publishes the model as a web service with name “AzureML-vignette-gbm”, and runs example data through the model for prediction using the `consume()` function.

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(gbm)

test <- Boston[1:5, 1:13]

set.seed(123)
gbm1 <- gbm(medv ~ ., distribution = "gaussian", n.trees = 5000, interaction.depth = 8,
            n.minobsinnode = 1, shrinkage = 0.01, cv.folds = 5, data = Boston, n.cores = 1) 
# You can set this to n.cores = NULL to use all cores
best.iter <- gbm.perf(gbm1, method="cv", plot=FALSE)

mypredict <- function(newdata){
  require(gbm)
  predict(gbm1, newdata, best.iter)}

# Example use of the prediction function
print(mypredict(test))
```

```{r}
# Publish the service
ep <- publishWebService(ws = ws, fun = mypredict, name = "AzureML-vignette-gbm", inputSchema = test)

# Consume test data, comparing with result above
print(consume(ep, test))
```

Notice that we don’t need to explicitly specific the inputSchema or outputSchema arguments when working with functions that use data frame I/O. When finished with this example, we can delete the example service with:

```{r}
deleteWebService(ws, "AzureML-vignette-gbm")
```

# Tips on writing functions used in web services

- Try to use the data frame I/O interface as illustrated in the last example above. It’s simpler and more robust than using functions of scalars or lists and exhibits faster execution for large data sets.
- Use `require()` in your function to explicitly load required packages.
- The `publishWebServce()` function uses codetools to bundle objects required by your function following R lexical scoping rules. The previous example, for instance, uses the best.iter and gbm1 variables inside of the `mypredict()` function. `publishWebService()` identified that and included their definitions in the R environment in which the function is evaluated in AzureML. Fine-grained control over the export of variables is provided by the `publishWebService()` function in case you need it (see the help page for details).
- Use the packages option of `publishWebService()` to explicitly bundle required packages and their dependencies (but not suggested dependencies) using miniCRAN. This lets you upload packages to AzureML that may not otherwise be available in that environment already, using the correct R version and platform used by AzureML.
- Be aware that the version of R running in AzureML may not be the same as the version of R that you are running locally. That means that some packages might not be available, or sometimes package behavior in the AzureML version of R might be different that what you observe locally. This is generally more of an issue for cutting-edge packages.
- JSON is used to transfer data between your local R environment and the R services running in AzureML–numeric values experience a change of base, which can lead to a small loss of precision in some circumstances. If you really, really need to move binary objects between your local R session and the AzureML R service you might try base64 encoding the data, for example.
